Project Overview:  
This project uses a fine-tuned BERT model to classify whether a given text is written by a Human or generated by an AI system.  
The Streamlit application allows users to input any text and view the classification result along with confidence scores.  

Dataset:  
• Custom dataset created with both Human-written and AI-generated text.  
• Labels:  
  - 0 -> Human  
  - 1 -> AI   
• Dataset can be further expanded for improved performance.  

Preprocessing:  
• Text cleaning and normalization  
• Tokenization using BERT tokenizer  
• Train-Test split for evaluation  

Features:  

Model:  
• BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)  
• Fine-tuned for binary text classification  
• Softmax output for confidence score  

Streamlit Web App:  
• User enters text  
• Model predicts class (Human / AI)  
• Displays confidence probability  
• Ngrok tunnel to share public link  

Installation:  
Required Python Libraries:  
• torch  
• transformers  
• scikit-learn  
• pandas  
• numpy  
• streamlit  
• pyngrok  

Usage:  
Train Model:  
• Run training script to fine-tune BERT (if modification required)  

Launch Streamlit App:   
streamlit run app.py  

Ngrok Tunnel:  
• Connect port (for deployment/public access)  

Saved Models:  
• BERT fine-tuned model: model.pth  
• Tokenizer files stored in working directory  

Results:  
• Predictions displayed with confidence score in UI  
• Streamlit output: “Human (xx%)” or “AI (xx%)”
